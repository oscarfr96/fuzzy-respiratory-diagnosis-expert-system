"""
This script demonstrates a simple fuzzy expert system for diagnosing respiratory illnesses.
It represents symptoms and diseases with fuzzy values (0.0 to 1.0) and uses a forward-chaining
inference engine. The engine evaluates rules, combines fuzzy values using min/max operators,
and attempts to provide a more nuanced output than a strict true/false system.

Please note: This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. In a real scenario,
you might use dedicated libraries (like scikit-fuzzy) and more sophisticated methods for
defining membership functions, combining rules, and defuzzifying results.
"""

# Possible diseases and symptoms:
# Diseases: flu, cold, pharyngitis
# Symptoms: fever, dry_cough, wet_cough, sore_throat, nasal_congestion, muscle_pain, sneezing

# Each symptom is represented with a fuzzy value: 0.0 (absent) to 1.0 (intense).

# Rules will be stored as a list of dicts:
# Each rule has:
# - conditions: a dict { symptom: expected_type, ... }
#   expected_type will just be the symptom name with a boolean indicating if we want it present or absent.
#   In a fuzzy system, we use the symptom's fuzzy value directly and combine them using min().
#
# - disease: a string representing the disease this rule supports.
#
# The inference engine will:
# 1. Take the fuzzy symptom values.
# 2. For each rule, compute the fuzzy support for that disease by using the min() of all involved symptoms,
#    optionally negating them by using (1 - value) if we want the absence of a symptom.
# 3. Combine multiple rules for the same disease by taking max() (OR) of their results.
#
# At the end, we get a fuzzy score for each disease.
